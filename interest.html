                <h2>BOOK</h2>
                <br>
                <p>My interest in reading and collecting books has been a significant part of my life. 
                    I find immense joy in exploring various genres and discovering new authors. 
                    One of my favorite series is the Empayar Series by Teme Abdullah, which has captured my imagination with its intriguing plots and well-developed characters. 
                    I admire the works of authors like Ainul Faatihah, Ramlee Awang Murshid, and many more whose writing resonates deeply with me.
                    Although I don't have a personal library per se, my collection of books continues to grow, and each title holds a special place in my heart.
                     Reading not only enriches my knowledge but also provides me with moments of relaxation and inspiration, allowing me to escape into different worlds and perspectives.</p>

                <h2>MOVIE/DRAMA</h2>
                <br>
                <p>One of my other interests revolves around watching movies, dramas, anime, or cartoons, especially when enjoyed with good food. 
                    Whether I'm watching at home with family and friends or going to the cinema, it's always a special experience. 
                    Recently, I had the opportunity to watch "How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies" at the cinema with my friends. 
                    The movie left a deep impact on us with its poignant storyline, and it was such an emotional journey that we found ourselves shedding tears throughout.
                     By the end, my tissue supply was nearly exhausted. Sharing these emotional moments with friends adds to the richness of the experience, making each movie outing a memorable event.</p>

                <h2>SONG</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Listening to music is an integral part of my daily life, accompanying me wherever I go, especially when I'm focused on homework or tasks. 
                    I enjoy exploring various genres and discovering new music, always open to different sounds and rhythms.
                     Music serves as a relaxing escape for me, and I often find myself singing along, despite not having a melodious voice. 
                     I have a multitude of favorite songs that resonate with me, bringing joy and comfort in their melodies. Recently, tracks like "Kembalilah" and "Kekasih Yang Dikasih" by Fathi Saleem have been on my playlist, adding to the diverse range of music I appreciate. 
                     The power of music lies in its ability to uplift my spirits and create a soothing atmosphere, making each listening experience meaningful and enjoyable.

                <p>Here is one song I've been listening to recently.</p>
